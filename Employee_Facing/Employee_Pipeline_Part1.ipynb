Generally, a “related party transaction” is a \\ntransaction or a series of transactions (other than Regulation O loans) that includes both \\nComerica and, either directly or indirectly, a director or Section 16 executive officer, when \\nsuch transaction(s) exceed $120,000 in amount per year.

Yes, because secondary employment (even in connection with a personal business) may \\naffect the services employees can render to Comerica's customers, or could give the \\nappearance of a conflict of interest with Comerica.

Otherwise, the loan could create the potential for a \\nconflict among your interests, the customer’s/vendor’s interests and those of Comerica.  In \\naddition, such an arrangement may appear to be akin to a gift and may appear to be intended \\nto influence you in the performance of your job. \\n \\nQ.  Your brother also works at Comerica.

Protecting Corporate Opportunities \\n \\n(a) To protect the interests of Comerica, as well as to avoid the appearance of conflicts of \\ninterest, we should not personally pursue business opportunities that would otherwise be \\navailable to Comerica as a reasonable business opportunity. \\n \\n(b) To protect the interests of Comerica, we must not use Comerica property or information, or \\nour position with Comerica, for improper personal gain. \\n \\n(c) To protect the interests of Comerica, as well as avoid conflicts of interest, we should avoid \\nsituations or arrangements in which we are or could be reasonably perceived as competing \\nwith Comerica. \\n \\n \\nIllustrative Scenarios: \\n \\nQ.

Toward that effort, \\nemployees should not have any expectation of privacy when it comes to Comerica’s \\nproperty or items brought on to Comerica’s property.  Comerica retains the right, \\nwhen it deems it reasonably necessary, to search the property made available for \\nemployees’ use and any personal belongings (purse, briefcase, bag, etc.) that \\nemployees may bring into the workplace if there is a legitimate business reason to do \\nso. In addition, areas like desks, lockers, cred'), Document(metadata={}, page_content=' workplace if there is a legitimate business reason to do \\nso. In addition, areas like desks, lockers, credenzas, cabinets, etc. are also subject to \\nsearch when reasonably necessary.  Comerica will not, however, conduct random \\nsearches of any employee’s personal belongings.  \\n \\n• Consistent with Comerica’s commitment to protect the privacy of its employees and \\ncustomers, employees are not permitted to use cell phones or other devices to record \\nconversations or interactions with customers and/or employees unless all parties to the \\nrecording are informed and have consented to the recording. \\n \\n8.   Risk Management \\n \\nRisk Management is a critical component of Comerica’s corporate strategy, which reinforces its \\nimportance. We recognize that nearly every action Comerica takes as a financial intermediary \\nrequires some degree of risk. Our corporate culture is not to eliminate risk, but to understand \\nand manage our risks, as well as receive appropriate compensation for accepting such risks. \\nCurrent and planned actions of colleagues must be reflective of Comerica’s risk appetite and \\n'), Document(metadata={}, page_content=' risks. \\nCurrent and planned actions of colleagues must be reflective of Comerica’s risk appetite and \\nrisk limits, which are guided by Comerica’s conservative culture.  We are committed to take \\ninto consideration the levels of risk acceptable to the organization in regard to business \\nopportunities and day-to-day activities.  As an employee, you are responsible for understanding \\nComerica’s Risk Appetite Statement, as it identifies the level of risk that is acceptable, and for \\nfollowing the policies and procedures in place to help identify, mitigate and manage risk \\neffectively. \\n \\nIllustrative Risk Management Activities: \\n \\n• \\n Data Integrity – documenting and validating information which the organization \\nutilizes is a critical component to understanding possible risks and being able to manage \\nthem effectively.  Decisions made based on inaccurate data could result in unnecessary \\nPage  13 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nlosses or be the cause of unprofitable decisions.  For Example:  Entering the wrong \\npricing rate for a loan in the system could result in Comerica not collecting sufficient \\nincome and cause difficult discussions with the borrower, harming future business. \\n \\n• \\n Effective Oversight – routinely reviewing internal procedures and adherence to those \\nprocedures helps to manage risk.  Without such oversight, Comerica is at risk for not \\ncomplying with laws and regulations or for potentially creating situations that can cause \\nloss, harm to Comerica, or distrust of Comerica, its employees or its customers.  For \\nExample:  Not ensuring that all applicable identification has been reviewed when \\nopening a new account (a required procedure) could lead to Comerica unknowingly \\nsupporting a terrorist organization. \\n \\n• \\n Risk Analysis – identification of potential risks and/or risk outcomes should be '), Document(metadata={}, page_content=' terrorist organization. \\n \\n• \\n Risk Analysis – identification of potential risks and/or risk outcomes should be \\ncontemplated and be a routine part of any analysis or opportunity assessment.  Fully \\nunderstanding our risks will lead to better decision making.  For Example:  The analysis \\ndone before changing a policy to speed up a process should include consideration of \\nchecks and balances that are being eliminated.  Though it may take extra time to \\nauthenticate an individual making a wire request, for instance, this process helps \\nprevents fraud and improves security.   \\n \\n9. \\nComplying with Applicable Laws \\n \\n(a) We should conduct our business at all times in accordance with all material laws, rules and \\nregulations that apply to our business and not engage in conduct that violates such laws, \\nrules and regulations. \\n \\n(b) Insider trading is both unethical and illegal.

(A copy of Comerica’s AML Policy is \\navailable on Connect under Enterprise Risk, Financial Intelligence, Anti-Money \\nLaundering, Libraries, Corporate AML Information, AML Policies.)  Comerica takes its \\nresponsibilities under its AML Policy very seriously; therefore, it is incumbent upon each \\nemployee to understand his/her responsibilities under the AML Policy.  An employee’s \\nresponsibilities under Comerica’s AML Policy are not transferable to a manager, \\nsubordinate, peer or any other agent or employee of Comerica.

Failure to adhere to Comerica’s AML Policy may result in disciplinary \\naction including, without limitation, termination. Any questions relating to Comerica’s \\nAML Policy should be directed to the Director of AML Compliance. \\n \\n(d) Understanding the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our business is important.  If we \\nare uncertain or have any question regarding any issue, we should contact an attorney in the \\nLegal Department or speak with the Chief Legal Officer.

An employee working for Comerica in a state where marijuana is legal under state law, \\nis engaged in the manufacture, sale and distribution of the drug through a side business.  Is \\nthis a violation of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees? \\n \\nA. Yes.  Federal regulations prohibit Comerica from employing individuals who are engaged in \\nthe manufacture, sale, distribution, or trafficking of an illegal controlled substance.  Marijuana is \\nconsidered a Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substances Act.  Therefore, it is still an \\nillegal controlled substance under federal law. \\n \\nQ. While at work, you learned Comerica is about to announce material information that \\ncould positively affect its stock price.   You had already been planning to buy some of our \\nstock because the current price is attractive, but you hadn’t given any instructions to your \\nbroker yet.

Can you warn your mother about the vendor so she can sell her stock before the \\nbad news comes out? \\n \\nA. No.  This would be a violation of the Insider Trading Policy.   In most circumstances, \\nincluding the example above, it is illegal to pass along material non-public information to others \\n(frequently called \"tipping\"), and a person'), Document(metadata={}, page_content=' is illegal to pass along material non-public information to others \\n(frequently called \"tipping\"), and a person who does so in violation of a duty to keep it \\nconfidential may be liable under securities laws if others trade while in possession of that \\nmaterial non-public information. \\n \\n10.    Other Comerica Policies \\n \\nIn many cases, Comerica has established Company policies that exceed the standards required \\nby law.  These policies govern our daily activities and may be corporate-wide or specific to a \\nbusiness unit.  We must become familiar with and understand such policies.  Many of the \\npolicies can be accessed through the Human Resources site on Connect and/or Comerica’s \\nCorporate Bulletin Board. \\n \\nPage  15 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n11.   Care with External Relationships \\n \\nTo help Comerica maintain excellent relationships with the public, we should take special care \\nin dealing with the media, government officials and community groups. \\n \\nMedia Relations: \\n \\nWe are committed to building and maintaining effective and ongoing communications with our \\nkey stakeholders through the media.  This helps ensure Comerica’s public statements express \\nclear and factual representations.  To this end, all media inquiries seeking Comerica’s position \\non an issue should be forwarded to Corporate Communications or Investor Relations. \\n \\nPolitical Activities: \\n \\nAs an employee, you are encouraged to be knowledgeable regarding state and federal legislative \\nissues affecting the financial industry. Comerica, itself, is an active participant in the public \\npolicy arena.  However, in any jurisdiction, if you interact with any government official or \\nemployee on behalf of Comerica, you must ensure the contact complies with legal requirements \\nand Comerica standards. \\n \\nFederal, state,'), Document(metadata={}, page_content=' must ensure the contact complies with legal requirements \\nand Comerica standards. \\n \\nFederal, state, and local laws govern all aspects of working with public officials.  For \\nexample, the federal government requires lobbyist registration and reports.  Lobbying activity \\ngenerally includes attempts to influence the passage or defeat of legislation.  The U.S. \\nGovernment and many states, however, have extended the definition of lobbying activity to \\ncover efforts to influence formal rulemaking by executive branch agencies or other official \\nactions of agencies, including the decision to enter into a contract or other financial \\narrangement.  Moreover, “grassroots” activity (where one communicates with the public or \\nsegment of the public, such as Comerica employees, encouraging them to call their \\nrepresentative or another public official for the purpose of influencing the passage of \\nlegislation or a rulemaking) is in many cases also considered lobbying activity. \\n \\nTo ensure that Comerica and its employees are in compliance with these laws, you may not \\nengage in any of the lobbying activities, as described above, on behalf of Comerica unless \\nyou receive'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='\\nengage in any of the lobbying activities, as described above, on behalf of Comerica unless \\nyou receive approval from Comerica’s Chief Legal Officer or a request from Comerica’s \\nPublic Affairs Department. \\n \\nOnline Social Media and Other External Communications: \\n \\nOnline social media is a growing method of communicating and doing business.

Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees is a values-based document, rather than compliance-based, which means it goes beyond a simple listing of right and wrong.  As you read through, you will see that the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees explains in detail the ethical business practices and conduct that must govern our life here at Comerica.  We are one of the leading financial institutions in the United States today.  There are many, many reasons for our success, but I believe a major reason is our integrity and trustworthiness - and that is what this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees is really all about.

Being Fair and Honest in All Business Dealings  We are expected to be fair, to act with honesty and to maintain the highest standards of personal integrity with one another and in all business dealings.  Illustrative Scenarios:  Q:  Your banking center has a goal of increasing the use of Web Banking and Mobile Banking services among its customers.  You believe these services provide great benefits, but some of your customers are hesitant to sign up.  Is it ever okay for you to sign them up without their knowledge?   A:  No, customers must enable these services on their own. You are expected to maintain the highest standards of integrity by being fair and honest in all business dealings. Signing them up without their knowledge would be wrong and a form of dishonest manipulation to reach your teams performance goal.   3. Avoiding Conflicts of Interest  (a) A conflict of interest generally refers to a situation where your personal interest interferes or reasonably appears to interfere with the interests of Comerica as a whole.

            "CONTENT: CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS FOR EMPLOYEES    Business Practices for Ethical Employee Conduct (Effective July 25, 2023) Dear Colleagues:  Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees is the most important document at Comerica.  It is the foundation on which all our business practices at Comerica are constructed and, for that reason, I consider it a critical one for each of us to read and understand.  Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees is a values-based document, rather than compliance-based, which means it goes beyond a simple listing of right and wrong.  As you read through, you will see that the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees explains in detail the ethical business practices and conduct that must govern our life here at Comerica.  We are one of the leading financial institutions in the United States today.  There are many, many reasons for our success, but I believe a major reason is our integrity and trustworthiness - and that is what this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees is really all about.  In the final analysis, at Comerica each of us is personally accountable for reading and understanding the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees, thinking about the principles on which it is constructed, and then incorporating those principles into our life.  If you have questions about the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees or any ethical issue you may face, please contact your manager, or the Corporate Legal, Human Resources or Audit Departments for assistance.  Alternatively, you may report ethics-related matters confidentially through one of Comericas hotlines, as described in more detail in the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees. Thank you.       Curtis C. Farmer  Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer SECTION 1  ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES   We should conduct our business in accordance with all material applicable laws, rules and regulations.   We should maintain the highest standards of ethical business conduct and integrity by:   Being fair and honest in all business dealings, including our professional relationships;   Properly maintaining all information and records, recognizing errors and, when an error is confirmed, promptly correcting it; and   Cooperating fully with all internal and external audits and investigations initiated or sanctioned by Comerica.   We must protect the confidentiality and privacy of confidential customer, shareholder, proprietary and third-party information and records.   We must make business decisions that align with Comericas risk appetite, are in the best interests of Comerica and without regard to personal gain.  This means that we should use good judgment and endeavor to avoid even the appearance of any conflict between our individual interests and those of Comerica.   BUSINESS CONDUCT  1.   Dealing Fairly with Others and Maintaining Professional Relationships  (a) To maintain an effective working environment, we must treat our clients, coworkers and business partners with fairness and respect, and we must maintain the highest standards of personal integrity.  (b) We are committed to providing all employees with a workplace free of conduct that may be considered harassing, abusive, and we will not unlawfully discriminate against anyone.   We will not tolerate unlawful harassment in any form.   To maximize our effectiveness as an organization, we must promote equal opportunity and diversity.  We must not unlawfully discriminate against others.  (c) We should deal fairly with customers, suppliers, competitors, and colleagues, and should not take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of confidential or privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other unfair-dealing practice. (d) Understanding that we represent Comerica at all times, we should strive to conduct our personal affairs, including our financial affairs, in a responsible and prudent manner.   Illustrative Scenarios:  Q. An employee in another manager's work group recently told you that a customer has made unwelcome sexual advances. She did not feel comfortable telling her male manager. You told her she needed to report the incident to Human Resources, but she decided not to do so. Since she does not report to you, have you done all you can do?  A.  No.   All employees are responsible for reporting violations of laws, rules, and regulations that apply to our business, as well as violations of this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees, to the extent that they know a violation of either has occurred. If you have observedbeen made aware of another employee being harassed and the harassment has not been reported, you should notify your manager or an HR Consultant promptly.  Comerica does not tolerate retaliatory action against any individual for good-faith reporting of an incident.  Q. It is Thursday evening and you are joining friends for dinner.  On your way to the restaurant, you stop at a Comerica banking center but it is closed for the day.\n",

Confidentiality and data protection We want to ensure that private information about clients, employees, partners and our company is well-protected. Examples of confidential information are:  Employee records  Unpublished financial information  Data of customerspartnersvendors  Customer lists (existing and prospective)  Unpublished goals, forecasts and initiatives marked as confidential  As part of our hiring process, we may ask you to sign non-compete and non-disclosure agreements (NDAs.) We are also committed to:   Restrict and monitor access to sensitive data.  Develop transparent data collection procedures.  Train employees in online privacy and security measures.  Build secure networks to protect online data from cyberattacks.  Establish data protection practices (e.g. secure locks, data encryption, frequent backups, access authorization.)  We also expect you to act responsibly when handling confidential information.  You must:  Lock or secure confidential information at all times.  Shred confidential documents when theyre no longer needed.  Make sure you view confidential information on secure devices only.  Only disclose information to other employees when its necessary and authorized.  Keep confidential documents inside our companys premises unless its absolutely necessary to move them.

We will terminate any employee who breaches our confidentiality guidelines for personal profit. We may also discipline any unintentional breach of this policy depending on its frequency and seriousness. We will terminate employees who repeatedly disregard this policy, even when they do so unintentionally. Harassment and violence To build a happy and productive workplace, we need everyone to treat others well and help them feel safe. Each of us should do our part to prevent harassment and workplace violence. Workplace harassment Harassment is a broad term and may include seemingly harmless actions, like gossip. We cant create an exhaustive list, but here are some instances that we consider harassment:   Sabotaging someones work on purpose.  Engaging in frequent or unwanted advances of any nature.  Commenting derogatorily on a persons ethnic heritage or religious beliefs.  Starting or spreading rumors about a persons personal life.  Ridiculing someone in front of others or singling them out to perform tasks unrelated to their job (e.g. bringing coffee) against their will.  Sexual harassment is illegal and we will seriously investigate relevant reports. If an employee is found guilty of sexual harassment, they will be terminated.  If youre being harassed, whether by a colleague, customer or vendor, you can choose to talk to any of these people:   Offenders. If you suspect that an offender doesnt realize they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the harassment. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues.) Avoid using this approach with customers or stakeholders.   Your manager. If customers, stakeholders or team members are involved in your claim, you may reach out to your manager. Your manager will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate.  HR. Feel free to reach out to HR in any case of harassment no matter how minor it may seem. For your safety, contact HR as soon as possible in cases of serious harassment (e.g. sexual advances) or if your manager is involved in your claim. Anything you disclose will remain confidential. Workplace violence Violence in our workplace is a serious form of harassment. It includes physical and sexual assault, destruction of property, threats to harm a person or property and verbal and psychological abuse. We want to avoid those incidents altogether, but we also want to be ready to respond if needed.  For this reason, we ask you to:   Report to HR if you suspect or know that someone is being violent. Your report will be confidential and we will investigate the situation with discretion.   Call our buildings security if you witness incidents of severe physical violence (e.g. ones that involve a lethal weapon.) For your safety, avoid getting involved.  We will treat employees who verbally threaten others as high risk and they will receive an appropriate penalty. If HR finds that an employee commits an act of violence, we will terminate that employee and possibly press criminal charges. Employees who damage property deliberately will be solely responsible for paying for it.   Supporting victims To support victims of workplace violence, we may:  Cover relevant medical bills.  Pay for mental health treatment if needed.   Provide victims with our lawyers services to help them file lawsuits.   Get help early on Seek help from others early on to mitigate conflicts. For example:    If you experience conflicts with a colleague, ask your manager for advice before tensions escalate. If these conflicts persist\n",

Human Resources, in consultation with Audit and Corporate Legal, as appropriate, is authorized to interpret and apply the provisions of this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees and to determine what actions constitute a violation of this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees.  We all are required to review this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees and report promptly in writing any circumstances which may be in conflict, or appear to be in conflict, with these practices and guidelines.  Employees should report to their supervisor and Human Resources Consultant. Agents should report to their relationship manager at Comerica.  We are responsible for reporting potential conflicts of interest in our own or other employees activities or behavior that we believe violate any law, rule, regulation, or provision of this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees or any other Comerica policy.  We must always remember that public confidence in the financial services industry can be eroded by irresponsible or improper conduct by any employee or agent.  Even the appearance of impropriety can be damaging to Comerica, as well as to our personal careers.  Employees are assured that no disciplinary action or retaliation of any kind will be taken or tolerated by Comerica as a result of an employee reporting in good faith a potential conflict of interest in another employees activities or a suspected violation of law, rule, regulation, or provision of this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees or any other Comerica policy by another employee.

It contains general statements of City policy and should not be read as including the fine details of each policy, nor as forming an express or implied contract or promise that the policies discussed in it will be applied in all cases. The City may add to this guide or revoke or modify it from time to time. The City will try to keep this guide current, but there may be times when a policy will change before this material can be revised, published and communicated. Notice: This Guide generally applies to all employees. However, in some instances employees who were hired before January 1, 2012 may be entitled to certain benefits that are not contained in this guide. The Human Resources Department is available to answer any questions regarding all human resource issues including benefit eligibility and questions. 2 3  Compensation Salary Administration The compensation strategy is based upon pay plans and policies that determine the classification of jobs into pay grades and pay steps. Exceptions to the pay plan may be made by the City Council.  The current salary schedule for General employees may be found on the City website (www.fdl.wi.gov).   1) Pay Plan  City pay plans include the schedule of pay ranges consisting of a minimum and maximum rate of pay for all classes of positions contained in each respective plan as well as the components and intended purposes for each feature of the respective plans\n",

Regular part-time employees electing family coverage are responsible for paying the difference between the total monthly family premium and the Citys contribution to the single coverage plan premium for full-time active employees.  Auxiant & Health Payment Systems  Auxiant is the Citys Third Party Administrator that processes claims for the health plan while Health Payment System (HPS) is the company that manages the provider network. Auxiant and HPS work very closely together to provide access to a comprehensive network of medical providers and process claims quickly and efficiently.   - Auxiant provides users access to their personal claims, flex accounts, provider directories, deductible and out-of-pocket amounts, prescription benefit information, and just about anything necessary to navigate and organize their health coverage plan by registering on their website (www.auxiant.com).  - HPS provides access to medical providers and pays the doctors on the employees behalf for in-network visits. Employees are billed by HPS once a month so they spend less time figuring out their health care bills and paying each separately. Their website (www.hps.md) also contains a provider search as well as billing and transaction history. 15  Summary of Benefits & Coverage The full Summary of Benefits and Coverage explains how the plan distributes costs for covered health care services. This summary can be found through Auxiant or Human Resources. It is also provided in the open enrollment packet each year.  Surviving Spouse & Dependent Children Health Insurance Continuation The City believes that the benefits discussed under Wisconsin Statutes 66.0137 (municipalities are required to contribute towards the health insurance premiums for fire fighters and continue to pay those premiums for the spouse andor dependent children of a fire fighter who dies in the line of duty) should be extended to the surviving spouse and dependent children of all City employees who die in the line of duty. Therefore, the City provides the following benefits should this occur:  1) The City will continue to pay the premiums for a surviving spouse until the spouse remarries or reaches age 65. 2) The City will continue to pay the premiums for a dependent child until the child reaches the age of 18 unless the child is a full-time student in secondary school OR a full-time or part-time student in an accredited college or university and has not reached the end of the calendar year in which heshe turns 27.  Prescription Drug Coverage The City of Fond du Lac currently contracts with National CooperativeRx (CVS Caremark) for all prescription coverage. CVS Caremark has convenient and affordable medication options as well as a multitude of digital tools. Save time, keep costs down and stay on top of your prescriptions. For more information, visit their website (www.caremark.com).    Specific costs can be found in the Summary of Benefits and Coverage provided by Human Resources.   Vision Discount Program Wisconsin Vision has developed a special discount program that is available to City of Fond du Lac employees and dependents who do not have any vision insurance. (The City does have a vision insurance option  please see Vision Insurance for more information.) This discount plan is good all year and can be used multiple times.   Corporate Care Clinic & Consumer Incentives The City of Fond du Lac works with FABOH and the Corporate Care Clinic to provide members under the health plan ways to save money. The Citys contract with the Corporate Care Clinic has a set list of several common services that are provided to City health plan members at no cost. (The list includes new patient visits, established patient visits, preventative visits, and disease management, with different levels based on care needed and the age of the patient.) There are other services provided that will be covered by insurance but may be subject to deductible and coinsurance. You can verify what coverage level your visit will likely be set at ahead of time by contacting Human Resources andor Auxiant.   Teladoc: Another great option for fast, cost-effective, non-urgent care is Teladoc. This popular program provides employees on the Citys health plan access to licensed physicians by phone, video, and mobile app 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. All services available through Teladoc are provided to members covered under the Citys health plan at no cost. 16  Consumer Incentives The City believes that if the health plan is saving money, the employee should be given a portion of those savings to help with the expenses of the visit and this is why Smart Choice MRI and NOVO Health were brought into the Citys consumer incentive program.   Smart Choice MRI is an in-network provider where lower deductible costs are incurred for those on the Citys health plan since the overall costs are less than the average MRI fee. The same state-of-the-art technology is used as in any other MRI facility and patients can generally schedule a visit more quickly than\n",

The WRS is a hybrid defined benefit plan containing elements of both a 401(k) or defined contribution plan and a defined benefit plan. This public pension plan is nearly 100 funded due to fiscal discipline, unique plan design and robust governance. This benefit is an automatic employee and employer contribution into a retirement savings account where it can accrue interest until withdrawn. There are withdrawal stipulations if the retiree is not yet at the required WRS age. More information can be found on the ETF website (www.etf.wi.gov) or through Human Resources.   ICMA-RC 457, IRA, & RHS Plans ICMA-RC is a non-profit independent financial services corporation that focuses on providing retirement plans for close to a million public sector participant accounts and approximately 9,000 retirement plans. The City works with ICMA-RC to help employees voluntarily contribute more into a 457 or IRA Plan for retirement savings beyond WRS. All of these contributions would be direct from payroll to assist with the process and can be changed at any time.   457 Deferred Compensation Plan A 457 Deferred Compensation Plan uses pre-tax contributions to help save for retirement. This plan has taxable withdrawals that must occur after separation. More information can be found on the ICMA-RC website or through Human Resources.   Roth IRA Plan A Roth IRA Plan uses after-tax contributions to help save for retirement. This plan has tax-free withdrawals and allows you to withdraw your contributions anytime without penalties.

This is not a plan that employees can contribute towards. More information can be found on the ICMA-RC website or through Human Resources. 25  Educational Assistance  The City of Fond du Lac encourages their employees to increase their education and qualifications to perform their job and prepare for advancement in their service to the City. There must be a personal commitment and investment from the employee to show they are willing to retain knowledge and obtain skills they would be gaining from this extra education. If an employee is interested in educational assistance, they should discuss it with their supervisor and will be led in the right direction.  Conditions Employees who are eligible for educational assistance must enter into an agreement with the City covering terms and conditions for receiving education assistance. The City reserves the right to determine appropriate terms and conditions for an employee to receive assistance.   Tuition Reimbursement The City will reimburse an employee, with which they have formed an agreement, according to the schedule shown below. It is the employees responsibility to provide proof of completion of the course and the grade earned:  For a grade of A earned  100 of tuition to be covered For a grade of B earned  75 of tuition to be covered For a grade of C earned  50 tuition to be covered  There will be no reimbursement for a grade of D or lower.

            "CONTENT:  Specifically, we prohibit employees from:  Creating a hostile or unpleasant environment.  Demanding or coaxing an employee to resign.  Victimizing, harassing or retaliating against an employee.  Forcing an employee to resign by taking unofficial adverse actions (e.g. demotions, increased workload). Termination Terminating an employee is always unpleasant but sometimes necessary. If that happens, we want to ensure we act lawfully and respectfully. We may terminate an employee either for cause or without cause.  For cause termination is justified when an employee breaches their contract, engages in illegal activities (e.g. embezzlement), disrupts our workplace (e.g. harasses colleagues), performs below acceptable standards or causes damage or financial loss to our company.   Without cause termination refers to redundancies or layoffs that may be necessary if we cease some of our operations or re-assign job duties within teams. We will follow applicable laws regarding notice and payouts.  We will offer severance pay to eligible employees. We may also help employees who were terminated without cause to find work elsewhere, if possible.   We may also compensate accrued vacation and sick leave upon termination, depending on local law. Whenever local law doesnt have relevant stipulations, we will pay accrued leave only to those who werent terminated for cause. We will also take into account union agreements and abide by agreed terms.  If you manage team members, avoid wrongful dismissal. When you terminate an employee for cause, we expect you to be certain you made the right choice and keep accurate performance andor disciplinary records to support your decision. References When we terminate employees, we may provide references for those who leave in good standing. This means that employees shouldnt have been terminated for cause. If you are laid off, you may receive references. Please ask your manager.  If you resign, you may ask for references and your manager has a right to oblige or refuse. Policy revision We will always strive for fairness and equal opportunity and penalize offensive and illegal behaviors. But, as laws and our environment change, we may revise and modify some of our policies.   We have established an annual revision of our handbook to bring it up to date with legislation and employment trends. We also ask you to contact HR if you spot any inconsistencies or mistakes. And, if you have any ideas about how to improve our workplace, we are happy to hear them.

Employment basics In this section, we explain our employee contract types and define our basic employment policies.  Employment contract types Full-time employees work at least 30 hours per week or 130 hours per month on average.  Part-time employees are those who work fewer than 30 hours per week.  Full-time and part-time employees can have either temporary or indefinite duration contracts. Full-time employees under an indefinite duration contract are entitled to our companys full benefits package.  Insert this if employees are in the U.S: We remind you that, in the U.S., employment is at-will. This means that you or our company may terminate our employment relationship at any time and for any non-discriminatory reason(s). Equal opportunity employment Companys name is an equal opportunity employer. We dont tolerate discrimination against protected characteristics (gender, age, sexual orientation, race, nationality, ethnicity, religion, disability, veteran status.) We want all employees (including executives and HR) to treat others with respect and professionalism. In practice, this means that we:   Hire and promote people based on skills, experience or potential and try to reduce bias in every process (e.g. through structured interviews.)   Make accommodations to help people with disabilities move about safely on our premises and use our products, services and equipment.

If the termination is for cause, the City will require payback on a prorated amount spent to date.  1 M120                                                                                                                                                              Rev. 1017           LOGO    Employee Termination Policy  Purpose It is the policy of Cabin Creek Health Systems to ensure that employee terminations, including voluntary and involuntary terminations and terminations due to the death of an employee, are handled in a professional manner with minimal disruption to the workplace. At-Will Employment Employment with Cabin Creek Health Systems is voluntary and subject to termination by the employee or Cabin Creek Health Systems at will, with or without cause, and with or without notice, at any time. Nothing in these policies shall be interpreted to be in conflict with or to eliminate or modify in any way the employment-at-will status of Cabin Creek Health Systems employees. Voluntary Terminations A voluntary termination of employment occurs when an employee submits a written or verbal notice of resignation to his or her supervisor or when an employee is absent from work for three consecutive workdays and fails to contact his or her supervisor (job abandonment). Procedures 1. Employees are requested to provide a minimum of two weeks' notice of their intention to separate from the company to allow a reasonable amount of time to transfer ongoing workloads. The employee should provide a written resignation notification to his or her manager. 2. Upon receipt of an employee's resignation, the manager will notify the human resource (HR) department by sending a copy of the resignation letter and any other pertinent information (i.e., employee's reason for leaving, last day of work). 3. The HR department will coordinate the employee's out-processing. This process will include the employee's returning all company property (computers, documentation, keys, etc.); a review of the employee's post-termination benefits status; and the employee's completion of an exit interview. 4. The employee's manager will complete a Supervisory Termination Summary and deliver the completed form to HR. 5. Employees who possess a security clearance (security codes to the building, computer passwords, etc.) must meet with administration for a debriefing no later than their last day of employment. Involuntary Terminations An involuntary termination of employment, including layoffs of over 30 days, is a management-initiated dismissal with or without cause. The inability of an employee to perform the essential functions of his or her job with or without a reasonable accommodation may also result in an involuntary termination. An employee may also be discharged for any legal reason, including but not limited to: misconduct, tardiness, absenteeism, unsatisfactory performance or inability to perform. 2 M120                                                                                                                                                              Rev. 1017     Procedures 1. Before any action is taken to involuntarily discharge an employee, the employee's manager must request a review by HR and the employee's immediate supervisor.  2. The termination review staff will be responsible for reviewing the circumstances and determining if discharge is warranted. If the staff recommends discharge, the employee's manager and an HR representative will notify the employee. The employee's manager should complete an Employee Change Form and notify HR and payroll of the last day worked by the employee.

Performance management We have built our performance management practices to:  Ensure you understand your job responsibilities and have specific goals to meet.  Provide you with actionable and timely feedback on your work.  Invest in development opportunities that help you grow professionally.  Recognize and reward your work in financial or non-financial ways (e.g. employee awards.)  To meet these objectives, we have:  Established annual bi-annual quarterly performance reviews. During these reviews, your manager will fill out your performance evaluation report and arrange a meeting with you to discuss it. Through these discussions, managers aim to recognize employees who are good at their jobs, identify areas of improvement and talk about career moves. Pay increases or bonuses are not guaranteed. But, we encourage managers to recommend rewards for their team members when they deserve them. There wont be any forced ranking or other comparison between employees, as our goal is to help all employees improve and develop their careers.   Instructed all managers to meet with their team members once per week to provide feedback and talk about their work and motivations. This way, you can receive feedback in a timely manner and avoid surprises during your annual bi-annual quarterly performance review. How we expect managers to lead employees If you manage a team, you are responsible for your team members performance. To conduct effective regular meetings and performance evaluations, we expect you to:   Set clear objectives. Your team members should know what you expect of them. When you first hire someone to your team, ensure they understand their job duties. Set specific goals for each team member (and team-wide if applicable.) Revisit those goals during annual bi-annual quarterly performance reviews.    Provide useful feedback. During scheduled meetings with your team members, give them both guidance and praise, as appropriate. Be fair and specific to help them understand and implement your feedback.   Keep your team members involved. There should be two-way communication between you and your team. Make your expectations clear, but always take your team members motivations and aspirations into account. Discuss training and development opportunities that may interest your team members.   Keep logs with important incidents about each one of your team members. These logs help you evaluate your team, but may also prove useful when rewarding, promoting or terminating your team members. Employee training and development We owe our success to our employees. To show our gratitude, we will invest in our employees professional development. We want employees to feel confident about improving their efficiency and productivity. We also want to help our employees achieve personal growth and success.  Each employee has 1,000 annually to spend on educational activities or material. Subscriptions and books are included in this budget, unless they are necessary for you to complete your everyday duties. Send your expenses to HR by email expenses software.   Apart from online courses, we offer these training opportunities:  Formal training sessions (individual or corporate.)  Employee coaching and mentoring.  Seats at industry conferences.  On-the-job training.  Job shadowing.  Job rotation. Development is a collective process. Team members and managers should regularly discuss learning needs and opportunities. And its HRs responsibility to facilitate any development activities and processes. Benefits and perks In this section, we describe what we offer to our employees. We provide information on our health insurance plans and benefits like work from home options and company-issued equipment. Employee health Employee health is important to us. We dont discriminate against people with disabilities or health conditions, but we want to do everything possible to help employees stay healthy. At a minimum, we provide group health insurance to all eligible employees. For more information about our insurance package, contact HR.  Insert this if you have more than 20 employees in the U.S: According to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), you may choose to continue your group health benefits for a limited period after leaving our company. This can happen after you experience a qualifying event, i.e. termination for reasons other than gross misconduct and reduction in your hours of employment. Covered spouses and children may also be able to extend their health coverage after certain qualifying events. Please ask HR for guidance.  We have also established non-smoking and substance abuse policies to protect employee health. We will create a workplace with minimal noise and good lighting and offer free healthy snacks, wellness programs. Workers compensation We strive to keep our workplace safe, but accidents may happen occasionally. Employees who are injured at work (by accident or disease) can receive wage replacement, medical care and rehabilitation benefits according to workers compensation laws, when appropriate. Please inform us of your injury as soon as possible. Ask HR for forms that you need to file a claim or contact your state agency for workers compensation.  Our company has a workers compensation policy according to guidelines of the states (or countries) we operate in.

            "CONTENT:  City Manager will also be responsible for the approval of the basic structure and overall ranking of job classifications based upon the recommendations of the Director of Human Resources and any outside compensation consultants hired by the City.    The Director of Human Resources will also be responsible for the overall administration of each pay plan and, in coordination with Department Heads, will make additions, subtractions, and modifications to classifications and the corresponding pay range assignments as needed between formal surveys and outside consultant services with the approval of the City Manager for reflection in future budget documents.    The pay plan groups together positions of similar responsibility into grade levels to establish an appropriate rate for each grade, and range for that grade.  The appropriate rate shall be based on internal ranking and external market conditions.  Pay Grades  Pay grades are established upon completion and analysis of a Job Description Questionnaire (JDQ).  The purpose of the Job Description Questionnaire (JDQ) is to collect and provide necessary information about the job (specific duties and responsibilities) to evaluate salary placement within the compensation structure, classify jobs for various legal requirements (i.e. FLSA), and to compile appropriate job descriptions. It is a systematic process used to establish internal equity among positions and the foundation for the development of an overall classification hierarchy. 5  It may include any of the following: - Demographic Information o Assists in reconciling job title discrepancies and clarifying supervisors as well as other position factors - Essential Duties & Responsibilities  o Primary Duties  Most important aspects of the job  WHAT is done rather than HOW it is done o Frequency and Percentage of Total Annual Time  - Tools & Technology o SoftwareTechnology  regularly used in order to perform the functions of the job o EquipmentMachinery regularly used in order to perform the functions of the job  Tools of the trade and specialized protective equipment - JudgmentsDecision-Making o Typical ProblemsChallenges o Possible Solution(s) to ProblemChallenge o Resources available andor used o Job Title of who reviews - Working relationships  interactions  contacts o Title of individuals with whom interaction takes place o Description of interaction o Why was it necessary  Overall purposegoal of interaction - SupervisionManagement o Area of ActionResponsibility  Supervisory and quasi-supervisory  Level of involvement  Yes, No, Provides Input o Direct supervision of Full-Time (FTE) employees  Authority to hire or fire other employees  Suggestions and recommendations as to hiring, firing, advancement, promotion, or any other change of status of other employees - Work EnvironmentPhysical Requirements o Physical effort and exposure to health hazards or hazardous environments over the course of a year  RarelyOccasionallyFrequently o Potential for injury in performance of the position  - Additional Employee Comments o Other identifiable features not recognized previously - Supervisor(s) title - Education Requirements for hire o Level of Education o Field of Study o Additional Information - Experience Requirements for hire o Years of Experience o Type of Experience  Specific field  Aspect of field 6   General work - CertificationsLicensureTraining to perform job o Specific requirements o How attainedprovided o Required upon hire OR may obtain after hire o Current practices  Extra compensation for certification pay  Employer reimbursement for obtainingrenewing - CommentsCorrectionsAdditions - Supervisor o Any additional comments by supervisor as it pertains to any of above information provided - CommentsCorrectionsAdditions  AdministrationHR o Any additional comments by AdministrationHR as it pertains to any of above information provided - Current Market review  Pay StepsRanges  Pay stepsranges are established within the pay grades.  The Fond du Lac City Council has chosen to match the market.  - Match the market - set pay levels relative to those in the existing marketplace. By matching the pay rates of its competitors, the organization ensures its compensation structure remains competitive, therefore improving its ability to attract and retain top talent. Although this approach allows employers to better manage labor costs, it also has the potential of placing the employer in a position of having to play catch-up, requiring larger adjustments to the compensation structure during tight labor markets.  - Pay range widths are established with a minimum, midpoint, and maximum based on goals for compensation within the organization o Compa-ratio  measures the relationship between the salary of an employee and the midpoint of the pay range for that employee  A Compa-ratio of 1.00 or 100 means that the employee is paid exactly what the industry average pays and is at the midpoint for the salary range o Market ratio  measures the relationship between the salary of an employee and the value of their position in the market - Analysis is completed as it relates to span of control and compression within the employees currently in the grade, and into the step appropriately aligned to the experience, education, and certifications obtained in prior employment positions as well as within the division to assign the proper step placement. - Employees progress through the steps based upon City Council annual approval of the budget. o Steps allow for growth over the years  o Steps allow for differentiation of\n",

Salary Adjustment  The salary schedule will be reviewed annually to consider overall changes of salaries inside the organization, the labor market, and economic conditions.  If a general adjustment is given, it 7  may be made either on a straight percentage basis, a flat dollar amount, or a combination of the two.  Such adjustment will normally be effective with Payroll 1.    Pay System - Pay periods are bi-weekly.  Hours worked during a pay period are ordinarily paid the following Friday of the subsequent pay period.   Step Increases - Step increases may be authorized by the City Council as part of the annual budget process.  Such increases will be effective with Payroll 1 until an employee has reached the final step in the series progression.  Other authorized step increases will be based upon successful completion of a successful probationary review.    Red  Circle  When an employees salary exceeds the existing pay range maximum, the employees pay is defined as red-circled.  A red-circled employee will not be eligible for further base-accumulating pay increases until hisher salary is within the salary range for the existing position.  Promotions - The City recognizes that career advancement through promotion is an important aspect of most employees working life.  This makes promotion an important recruitment and retention tool for the City.  A promotion occurs when an existing employee is competitively selected as the most qualified candidate for an existing vacant position; or as a means to reward an employee who has mastered all elements of the current job and meets the requirement of a higher-level job.  When circumstances warrant, the City reserves the right to fill positions by offering promotions to current employees.  The City further reserves the right to determine what the appropriate level of compensation and benefits an employee will receive if heshe chooses to accept the promotion. Most employees may anticipate at least a 2.5 increase in pay when accepting a promotion.  All promotions will include an orientation period set by the City.  If the employee is unable to satisfactorily complete the orientation period in the new position, the City may offer the employee the opportunity to return to hisher previous position if it is still available.  Example: Clerk CashierGrade 3, Step 6, making 18.62 an hour, is promoted to Administrative Assistant on Grade 4.  The employee would be placed no lower than Grade 4, Step 3, making 19.35 an hour because that is closest step that provides at least a 2.5 increase.  However, the City may also place the employee on Grade 4 at a higher step if circumstances warrant a larger increase.  Transfers  Occasionally, the City may require an employee to change jobs in order to better meet the needs of City operations andor the public.  In those cases, the City may seek volunteers to transfer to the position.  If there are no volunteers or the City determines that the volunteers do not meet the minimum qualifications, the City may choose an employee for an involuntary transfer. Employees may also request to transfer to a vacant position.  The City reserves the right to determine the appropriate compensation level for any transfer to a new position.  Demotions  Unfortunately, there may be occasions when an employee is demoted due to performance issues, work-related misconduct, or changes in the composition of the workforce.  In such cases the City will determine in its sole discretion the appropriate placement of the employee for wage and benefit levels.   Further, employees may voluntarily request a demotion for a variety of reasons such as job satisfaction or personal needs.  In those cases the City will work with employees to help with the transition and to 8  ensure that the position is meeting the employees and the Citys needs. As with other demotions, the City reserves the right to determine the employees level of compensation and benefits in their new positions.  Reclassifications  Reclassifications can occur for a variety of reasons including but not limited to changes in job duties or reorganizations of City departments or divisions.  A reclassification is used is when there is a substantive change to the duties and responsibilities of a job that may occur due to changes in organization, type of work, staffing requirements, technology; or when the classification (title, grade, or status) assigned to the job is incorrect based on the actual job duties.  The City periodically reviews all position descriptions and the overall compensation plan to ensure that employees are classified correctly.  When the City determines\n",
