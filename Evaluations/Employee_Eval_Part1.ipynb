Phishing emails often appear legitimate by spoofing trustworthy entities, such as your CEO, a customer, or a business partner. They can install Trojans via malicious attachments or pose as ads on a website, exploiting vulnerabilities to obtain sensitive information. Embedding links in emails that redirect users to unsecured websites requesting sensitive information is also common. To avoid phishing attempts, employees should be cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources, use strong passwords, and seek assistance from Security Specialists if an email's safety is uncertain.\n",
            "            The System Access Control Policy states that employees are not authorized to use WorkForce Central technology resources to access personal social media accounts and blogs. Personal use of email is allowed for safe content, avoiding spamming and disclosing confidential information. Employees should avoid signing up for illegal, unreliable, disreputable, or suspect websites and services and sending unauthorized marketing content or emails. Solicitation of email for any other email address, other than that of the poster's account, with the intent to harass or to collect replies, is not allowed. Creating or forwarding \"chain letters\", \"Ponzi\", or other \"pyramid\" schemes of any type, and posting the same or similar non-business-related messages to large numbers of Usenet newsgroups (newsgroup spam) are also not authorized. Employees are expected to avoid signing up for illegal, unreliable, disreputable or suspect websites and services, sending unauthorized marketing content or emails, registering for a competitor's services unless authorized, sending insulting or discriminatory messages and content, intentionally spamming other people's emails, including coworkers. In general, employees should use strong passwords and be vigilant in catching emails that carry malware or phishing attempts. If unsure about an email's safety, employees should ask Security Specialists for assistance. Social media usage includes two aspects: using personal social media at work and representing the company through social media. Using personal social media at work can give cybercriminals access to the company's network by giving away sensitive information. Phishing emails often attempt to acquire sensitive information by masquerading as trustworthy entities, such as the CEO, a customer, or a business partner, through sophisticated and subtle methods\n",
